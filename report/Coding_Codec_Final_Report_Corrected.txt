Chapter 3: Literature Review

3.1 Gamification in Education
The application of gamification principles in educational contexts has gained significant traction in recent years. Deterding et al. (2011) define gamification as "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts," which has proven particularly effective in educational environments. Research by Hamari et al. (2014) demonstrates that gamification can increase student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes when properly implemented.

In the context of programming education, gamification addresses several key challenges. First, it provides immediate feedback through points and badges, which helps maintain student engagement during the often-frustrating process of learning to code. Second, it creates clear progression paths through levels and achievements, giving learners a sense of advancement even when tackling complex concepts.

The badge system implemented in Coding Codec draws inspiration from successful gamified platforms like Khan Academy and Codecademy. These platforms demonstrate that visual representations of achievement can significantly impact user motivation and retention rates.

3.2 Motivation Theory and Learning
Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Deci and Ryan (2000), provides a framework for understanding how gamification elements can enhance intrinsic motivation. The theory identifies three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The Coding Codec platform addresses these needs through:

- Autonomy: Users can choose which challenges to attempt and progress at their own pace
- Competence: The badge system and immediate feedback provide clear indicators of skill development
- Relatedness: The leaderboard system creates a sense of community and friendly competition

Research by Ryan and Deci (2017) suggests that satisfying these three needs leads to enhanced motivation, engagement, and well-being in educational contexts.

3.3 Programming Education Research
Studies in computer science education highlight the importance of hands-on practice in programming instruction. Robins et al. (2003) emphasize that programming is fundamentally a skill-based discipline that requires extensive practice to master. Traditional lecture-based approaches often fail to provide sufficient opportunities for active learning.

The challenges implemented in Coding Codec follow best practices identified in programming education research:
- Scaffolded learning progression from simple to complex concepts
- Immediate feedback on code submissions
- Real-world applicable examples rather than abstract exercises
- Multiple attempts encouraged to promote iterative learning

3.4 User Experience in Educational Software
Nielsen's usability heuristics (1994) provide guidelines for creating effective user interfaces, which are particularly important in educational software where poor usability can hinder learning. The Coding Codec interface incorporates several key principles:

- Visibility of system status through progress indicators
- Match between system and real world through familiar programming terminology
- User control and freedom allowing users to navigate freely between challenges
- Consistency in design elements and interaction patterns

Research by Squire (2011) on game-based learning emphasizes the importance of balancing challenge and skill level to maintain user engagement, a principle reflected in the graduated difficulty of the platform's challenges.

Chapter 5: Technical Implementation

5.1 Development Environment

The development environment was configured to support modern .NET development practices:

5.1.1 Development Tools
- Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE
- .NET 8.0 SDK for application development
- SQL Server Management Studio for database management
- Git for version control and collaboration
- PowerShell for command-line operations

5.1.2 Framework Versions
- ASP.NET Core 8.0: Web application framework
- Entity Framework Core 9.0.5: Object-relational mapper
- Bootstrap 5: CSS framework for responsive design
- jQuery 3.6.0: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation

5.2 Backend Implementation

5.2.1 Application Structure
The backend follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

```csharp
// Program.cs - Application entry point and configuration
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<PlatformDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

// Configure session services
builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
});

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseSession();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
```

5.2.2 Authentication Implementation
The authentication system uses custom session-based authentication:

```csharp
// AuthController.cs - User authentication logic
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        var user = await _context.Users
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(u => u.Email == model.Email);
        
        if (user != null && BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.Verify(model.Password, user.PasswordHash))
        {
            HttpContext.Session.SetString("UserId", user.UserId.ToString());
            HttpContext.Session.SetString("Username", user.Username);
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
        
        ModelState.AddModelError("", "Invalid email or password.");
    }
    return View(model);
}
```

5.2.3 Challenge Evaluation System
Code validation uses pattern matching for security and simplicity:

```csharp
// ChallengeController.cs - Challenge submission handling
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Submit(int id, string submittedCode)
{
    var challenge = await _context.Challenges.FindAsync(id);
    var userId = GetCurrentUserId();
    
    bool isCorrect = submittedCode.Contains(challenge.SolutionTemplate);
    
    if (isCorrect)
    {
        // Record progress
        var progress = new Progress
        {
            UserId = userId,
            ChallengeId = id,
            Completed = true,
            CompletedAt = DateTime.Now,
            SubmittedCode = submittedCode
        };
        
        _context.ProgressRecords.Add(progress);
        
        // Award points and badges
        await AwardPointsAndBadges(userId, challenge);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        
        return Json(new { success = true, message = "Challenge completed!" });
    }
    
    return Json(new { success = false, message = "Solution not correct. Try again!" });
}
```

5.2.4 Gamification Logic
The badge system automatically awards achievements based on user progress:

```csharp
// GamificationController.cs - Badge awarding logic
private async Task AwardBadges(int userId)
{
    var user = await _context.Users.FindAsync(userId);
    var completedChallenges = await _context.ProgressRecords
        .CountAsync(p => p.UserId == userId && p.Completed);
    
    var badgesToAward = new List<string>();
    
    // First Challenge badge
    if (completedChallenges >= 1 && !HasBadge(userId, "FirstChallenge"))
        badgesToAward.Add("FirstChallenge");
    
    // Challenge Master badge
    if (completedChallenges >= 3 && !HasBadge(userId, "ChallengeMaster"))
        badgesToAward.Add("ChallengeMaster");
    
    // Point Collector badge
    if (user.Points >= 50 && !HasBadge(userId, "PointCollector"))
        badgesToAward.Add("PointCollector");
    
    foreach (var badgeKey in badgesToAward)
    {
        _context.UserBadges.Add(new UserBadge
        {
            UserId = userId,
            BadgeKey = badgeKey,
            UnlockedAt = DateTime.Now
        });
    }
}
```

5.3 Frontend Implementation

5.3.1 Responsive Design
The frontend uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts:

```html
<!-- _Layout.cshtml - Main layout template -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Coding Codec</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-primary">
        <div class="container">
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Coding Codec</a>
            <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav">
                <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
                <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto">
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="/Challenge">Challenges</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="/Leaderboard">Leaderboard</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="/Gamification/Achievements">Achievements</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>
    
    <main role="main" class="container mt-4">
        @RenderBody()
    </main>
</body>
</html>
```

5.3.2 Interactive Elements
JavaScript provides dynamic user interactions:

```javascript
// Challenge submission with AJAX
function submitChallenge(challengeId) {
    const code = document.getElementById('codeInput').value;
    const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn');
    
    submitBtn.disabled = true;
    submitBtn.textContent = 'Submitting...';
    
    fetch(`/Challenge/Submit/${challengeId}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        },
        body: `submittedCode=${encodeURIComponent(code)}`
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        if (data.success) {
            showSuccessMessage(data.message);
            updateProgress();
        } else {
            showErrorMessage(data.message);
        }
    })
    .finally(() => {
        submitBtn.disabled = false;
        submitBtn.textContent = 'Submit Code';
    });
}
```

5.4 Database Implementation

5.4.1 Entity Framework Configuration
The database context manages all entity relationships:

```csharp
// PlatformDbContext.cs - Database context
public class PlatformDbContext : DbContext
{
    public PlatformDbContext(DbContextOptions<PlatformDbContext> options) : base(options) { }

    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Challenge> Challenges { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Progress> ProgressRecords { get; set; }
    public DbSet<UserBadge> UserBadges { get; set; }
    public DbSet<TutorialProgress> TutorialProgressRecords { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Friendship> Friendships { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Configure entity relationships
        modelBuilder.Entity<Progress>()
            .HasKey(p => p.ProgressId);
            
        modelBuilder.Entity<Progress>()
            .HasOne<User>()
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(p => p.UserId);
            
        modelBuilder.Entity<UserBadge>()
            .HasOne<User>()
            .WithMany()
            .HasForeignKey(ub => ub.UserId);
    }
}
```

5.4.2 Data Seeding
Initial challenge data is seeded during application startup:

```csharp
// ChallengeSeeder.cs - Initial data population
public static class ChallengeSeeder
{
    public static void Seed(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        using var context = new PlatformDbContext(
            serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<DbContextOptions<PlatformDbContext>>());
            
        if (!context.Challenges.Any())
        {
            context.Challenges.AddRange(
                new Challenge
                {
                    Title = "Hello World",
                    Description = "Write a C# program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.",
                    SolutionTemplate = "Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");",
                    TestCases = "Output:Hello, World!",
                    Points = 10,
                    Category = "Basic Syntax",
                    Difficulty = "Beginner"
                },
                new Challenge
                {
                    Title = "Sum of Two Numbers",
                    Description = "Create a C# method that takes two integers and returns their sum.",
                    SolutionTemplate = "public static int AddNumbers(int a, int b)\n{\n    return a + b;\n}",
                    TestCases = "Input:1,2;Output:3|Input:5,7;Output:12|Input:-3,3;Output:0",
                    Points = 15,
                    Category = "Methods & Functions",
                    Difficulty = "Beginner"
                },
                new Challenge
                {
                    Title = "Variable Declaration",
                    Description = "Declare and initialize variables of different C# data types.",
                    SolutionTemplate = "int age = 25;\nstring name = \"John\";\nbool isStudent = true;\ndouble height = 5.9;",
                    TestCases = "Output:Variables declared successfully",
                    Points = 10,
                    Category = "Variables & Data Types",
                    Difficulty = "Beginner"
                },
                new Challenge
                {
                    Title = "Reverse a String",
                    Description = "Write a C# method that takes a string and returns it reversed.",
                    SolutionTemplate = "public static string ReverseString(string input)\n{\n    return new string(input.Reverse().ToArray());\n}",
                    TestCases = "Input:hello;Output:olleh|Input:C#;Output:#C|Input:programming;Output:gnimmargorP",
                    Points = 20,
                    Category = "String Manipulation",
                    Difficulty = "Beginner"
                }
            );
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}
```

Chapter 6: Testing and Validation

6.1 Testing Methodology

A comprehensive testing strategy was implemented to ensure the platform's reliability and functionality. The testing approach included multiple levels:

6.1.1 Unit Testing
Individual components were tested in isolation to verify correct behavior:

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class AuthControllerTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Register_ValidInput_CreatesUser()
    {
        // Arrange
        var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<PlatformDbContext>()
            .UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: "TestDb")
            .Options;
        
        using var context = new PlatformDbContext(options);
        var controller = new AuthController(context);
        
        var model = new RegisterViewModel
        {
            Username = "testuser",
            Email = "test@example.com",
            Password = "TestPassword123"
        };
        
        // Act
        var result = controller.Register(model).Result;
        
        // Assert
        Assert.IsInstanceOfType(result, typeof(RedirectToActionResult));
        Assert.AreEqual(1, context.Users.Count());
    }
}
```

6.1.2 Integration Testing
End-to-end scenarios were tested to verify system integration:

```csharp
[TestClass]
public class ChallengeSubmissionTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void SubmitChallenge_CorrectSolution_AwardsPointsAndBadge()
    {
        // Arrange
        var user = CreateTestUser();
        var challenge = CreateTestChallenge();
        var correctCode = challenge.SolutionTemplate;
        
        // Act
        var result = SubmitChallengeCode(user.UserId, challenge.ChallengeId, correctCode);
        
        // Assert
        Assert.IsTrue(result.Success);
        Assert.AreEqual(challenge.Points, GetUserPoints(user.UserId));
        Assert.IsTrue(HasBadge(user.UserId, "FirstChallenge"));
    }
}
```

6.2 User Acceptance Testing

User acceptance testing was conducted with a group of 10 student volunteers to evaluate the platform's usability and effectiveness.

6.2.1 Test Scenarios
Users were asked to complete the following tasks:
1. Register a new account

Chapter 1: Introduction
As a final-year Computing student with a strong interest in software development and user-centered design, I wanted to create a meaningful, useful, and technically challenging capstone project that would align with both my academic background and career goals. This led to the conception of "Coding Codec", an educational web platform built to teach C# programming through a gamified and interactive interface. The vision was to deliver a platform that didn't just teach syntax and logic, but encouraged users to learn by doing – to develop skills by solving real challenges in a supportive, fun, and motivating environment.

This chapter presents an overview of the project, its aims, the scope of the work undertaken, and the methodology adopted. It outlines the rationale behind the selection of the project theme and details the strategic objectives I set at the outset.

1.1 Rationale Behind the Project
The idea for this project arose from my experiences as both a learner and a peer observer. Having used educational platforms like Duolingo, FreeCodeCamp, and Codecademy, I became increasingly aware of the potential of gamified learning environments. Duolingo, in particular, inspired me due to its user engagement strategies – especially its badge system, daily streaks, level progression, and points system – which made the otherwise tedious task of language acquisition feel rewarding.

However, when it came to learning programming – especially C#, which is widely used in enterprise environments – I noticed that many beginner platforms lacked the structure and motivation that language-learning apps offered. Most tutorials felt too passive and lacked interactivity, while many challenge-based coding platforms skipped over essential theory or overwhelmed beginners. I identified a gap: an opportunity to create a beginner-friendly, structured, and gamified environment specifically for learning C#.

Thus, the idea of "Coding Codec" was born. The platform is designed to teach basic and intermediate-level C# programming skills through short tutorials, hands-on coding challenges, and a rewarding experience that encourages consistent practice.

1.2 Project Aims
The primary aim of the project is to develop a feature-rich, full-stack web platform that facilitates interactive programming education using C#. The system should support users through a guided learning experience – from theoretical explanation to practical application – with built-in feedback, reward mechanisms, and progress tracking.

More specifically, the platform aims to:
• Deliver a structured and responsive web application accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
• Provide an environment for users to complete guided tutorials, solve programming challenges, and track their learning journey.
• Integrate gamification features such as points, levels, badges, and leaderboards to foster motivation.
• Include user authentication, profile customization, and security measures to ensure a safe and personalized learning experience.
• Lay the foundation for future scalability, with scope for the addition of more content, third-party integrations, and social features.

1.3 Project Objectives
To achieve the above aims, I defined a set of clear objectives. These objectives also served as development milestones during the implementation phase:

1. Develop a custom authentication system that supports secure registration, login, logout, and password hashing using BCrypt.
2. Design and build a database schema to manage users, challenges, progress, achievements, and tutorials.
3. Create a modular and scalable backend using ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC and Entity Framework Core 9.0.5.
4. Build a responsive frontend using Bootstrap 5 and Razor Pages that adapts seamlessly across devices.
5. Implement core learning features including a curated set of 4 coding challenges across different difficulty levels.
6. Develop a gamification engine that awards points, tracks progress, and unlocks 6 achievement badges upon milestone completion.
7. Introduce a leaderboard that dynamically reflects the top users and encourages friendly competition.
8. Implement a tutorial system with progress tracking for additional learning content.

Each of these objectives was tracked during the course of development, allowing me to evaluate my progress and adjust scope where necessary to meet deadlines and maintain code quality.

1.4 Project Scope
The scope of "Coding Codec" was clearly defined to ensure it was both achievable within the timeframe and aligned with the capstone module requirements. While ambitious, I deliberately limited certain features in the first version to prioritize quality and core functionality. The scope was divided into "must-have," "should-have," and "could-have" features:

• Must-Have Features:
  o Secure user registration and login with BCrypt password hashing
  o Interactive coding challenges with pattern-based validation
  o Progress tracking and database persistence
  o Gamification via badges and points
  o Responsive UI for multiple devices

• Should-Have Features:
  o Leaderboard for competitive comparison
  o Tutorial system with completion tracking
  o Dynamic statistics on home page
  o Mobile-optimized interface

• Could-Have Features (deferred):
  o Social features (friend system, challenge sharing)
  o Notifications and reminders
  o Code execution sandbox for dynamic validation
  o Admin panel for content management

This structured approach allowed me to manage expectations and dedicate my focus to the features that aligned most directly with user value and learning outcomes.

1.5 Methodology
I adopted a lightweight Agile development methodology, structured around iterative progress. Each week was planned with clear goals: feature development, testing, debugging, user feedback, and refinement. Although I was the sole developer, I maintained a backlog and sprint log to stay accountable to progress.

Each module or feature – such as user registration, challenge submission, or the achievement tracker – was developed in isolation, tested, and then integrated into the main codebase. I frequently used Git for version control and took backups to ensure rollback safety in case of regressions.

Furthermore, I maintained consistent communication with my supervisor, Rory O'Donnell, throughout the development cycle. Our meetings helped me evaluate risks, stay on track, and make design decisions based on feedback.

1.6 Target Audience
The intended user base for "Coding Codec" consists of:
• Beginners and students who are new to C# and looking for a guided, interactive introduction.
• Self-taught developers wanting a structured refresher course in C# fundamentals.
• Teachers and instructors seeking a platform to supplement their in-class material or online curriculum.
• Career changers interested in transitioning into tech and looking for hands-on practice in a friendly environment.

To serve this wide range of users, I designed the interface to be intuitive and the language to be approachable, avoiding jargon wherever possible. The challenge difficulty levels were categorized (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), allowing users to progress at their own pace.

1.7 Assumptions
At the beginning of the project, I operated under a few key assumptions:
1. Users would have access to a modern browser and stable internet connection.
2. The system would initially support only C# syntax, not other programming languages.
3. Content (tutorials, challenges) would be pre-seeded in the database, not generated or uploaded by users.
4. Code submissions would be validated via pattern recognition and not compiled/executed on the server for security and simplicity.

These assumptions simplified the system design while laying the groundwork for future enhancements, such as integrated compilers or multilingual support.

1.8 Conclusion
The first chapter of this report establishes the vision, goals, and structure of "Coding Codec." Born out of a passion for both software development and digital learning, the project combines my technical capabilities with my interest in user engagement and educational tools. By carefully scoping the system and using proven development methodologies, I was able to translate this idea into a functioning application that meets both educational and technical standards.

In the chapters that follow, I will present the background research that informed my project decisions, a detailed literature review of educational and gamification theories, and a breakdown of the design, development, and testing processes that led to the final product.

Chapter 2: Background (Expanded to ~1,500 words)
This chapter provides a contextual foundation for the "Coding Codec" project. It outlines the educational, technological, and motivational considerations that led to the development of a gamified C# learning platform. The background section also discusses the anticipated impact of the platform on its intended audience and explores the underlying motivations for my design decisions, rooted in both academic research and practical experiences.

2.1 Educational Context and Digital Learning Trends
In the modern digital era, the demand for accessible and engaging programming education has surged. As software development continues to grow in scope and influence, so too does the necessity for new programmers to enter the workforce equipped with both conceptual understanding and practical skills. Platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and FreeCodeCamp have paved the way for remote learning, yet many of these systems focus on video-based delivery with limited interactivity. Others assume prior experience, which can be discouraging for absolute beginners.

From the perspective of a learner, these platforms are often passive. Learners consume videos or articles but have limited opportunities for hands-on practice or reinforcement. Feedback, when available, tends to be generic or delayed. This disconnection between theory and practice can cause frustration, reduce motivation, and lead to premature disengagement. Based on both my observations and discussions with peers, I realized there was a clear opportunity to bridge this gap by building an active learning environment – one where users engage with the material directly, receive instant feedback, and feel rewarded for their progress.

The move toward gamified education represents a shift in pedagogical approaches. Research consistently shows that gamification – the application of game-design elements in non-game contexts – improves motivation, encourages consistent practice, and fosters deeper engagement. This approach has been applied successfully in language learning (e.g., Duolingo), fitness (e.g., Fitbit), and productivity apps (e.g., Habitica). It has also shown promising results in education, particularly in STEM subjects, where learners often struggle with abstract concepts.

With this in mind, I envisioned "Coding Codec" as a response to these trends: an interactive, gamified, and user-friendly platform that could make C# programming approachable and engaging for newcomers.

2.2 The Motivation Behind Learning C#
C# was selected as the target language for several reasons. First, it is a widely used language in professional environments – particularly for desktop applications, backend systems, and game development (via Unity). Secondly, the .NET ecosystem has matured significantly and offers robust tools, libraries, and frameworks that are ideal for enterprise-level development. Finally, C# has a relatively consistent syntax and supports both object-oriented and functional paradigms, making it suitable for teaching core programming principles.

In educational contexts, C# also represents a sweet spot between beginner-friendly structure and real-world applicability. Unlike scripting languages such as JavaScript or Python, C# introduces concepts like strong typing, class-based inheritance, and memory management more explicitly. These concepts are foundational for learners looking to move into more advanced software development roles later in their careers.

Despite its professional strengths, C# is often overlooked in entry-level learning platforms in favour of lighter scripting languages. This creates an opportunity to design a platform that demystifies C# and gives learners a solid starting point in a language that is both academically rich and professionally useful.

2.3 My Personal Experience and Inspiration
Before beginning this project, I had previously interned at a company where I contributed to the development of internal web applications and participated in backend development projects. During that internship, I became increasingly comfortable with database management, data validation, and full-stack workflows. However, I also witnessed how new hires often struggled with learning C#, especially those coming from non-technical backgrounds.

This experience – combined with my own journey through web development – helped shape my understanding of how learning platforms succeed or fail. I observed that structured systems with interactive components, clear milestones, and regular encouragement outperformed static or lecture-driven content by a large margin. Users want to feel that they are progressing, that their actions are meaningful, and that they are part of a journey – not just reading a tutorial page.

These insights motivated me to replicate that sense of progress and reward through a carefully designed gamification system. My goal was not just to build an educational tool, but to create an environment where learning feels like achieving – where every completed challenge is an accomplishment and every badge unlock is a reason to continue.

2.4 Anticipated Impact and User Benefits
The goal of "Coding Codec" is to help new programmers build confidence and skill in a low-pressure, encouraging environment. By designing a platform that rewards practice and celebrates progress, I aim to reduce the intimidation often associated with programming. Users begin with simple challenges, earn points and badges, and gradually build momentum – much like levelling up in a game.

For learners, this has numerous benefits:
• Lowered learning anxiety: The platform avoids penalizing incorrect answers harshly. Instead, it encourages iterative improvement, mimicking real-world development workflows.
• Increased engagement: Immediate feedback, colourful visuals, and score-based rewards contribute to a sense of satisfaction and progress.
• Autonomy and pace control: Users can choose which challenges to complete, in which order, and how fast they progress.
• Peer motivation: Leaderboards and public achievement displays foster healthy competition and encourage regular use.

Instructors and educators may also benefit by using the platform to supplement their own curricula. Since the system tracks progress and completion, teachers could potentially monitor student engagement or assign challenges as homework tasks.

2.5 Technological Foundations
Choosing the right tools was essential to the success of this project. I opted to build the platform using the ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC framework, a powerful and modern web development platform offered by Microsoft. This choice was guided by several factors:

• Familiarity and relevance: I had prior experience using C# and .NET technologies, which allowed me to hit the ground running. In addition, these technologies are in demand in enterprise environments, adding professional relevance to the project.
• Security and scalability: ASP.NET Core offers built-in support for authentication, routing, session management, and security – all essential for a web application dealing with user data.
• Separation of concerns: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture provided a clear and scalable structure that separates the frontend (View), backend logic (Controller), and data access (Model).

For the database, I used SQL Server LocalDB in conjunction with Entity Framework Core 9.0.5 – an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allowed me to define database schemas through C# models. This approach enabled a seamless link between user actions and stored data, ensuring that each badge earned or challenge completed was tracked reliably.

The frontend was styled with Bootstrap 5, which provided responsiveness and UI components that work across desktop and mobile devices. Razor Pages were used for dynamic content rendering.

This stack provided me with everything I needed to build a full-stack, responsive, and secure platform.

2.6 Key Use Cases
To illustrate the kinds of experiences the platform was designed to support, here are a few sample user journeys:

Use Case 1: A Beginner Learner
Sarah is new to programming and wants to learn C#. She registers on Coding Codec and is greeted with a clean, welcoming interface. She starts with the "Hello World" challenge, which walks her through writing her first C# program. When she submits correct code, she earns 10 points and unlocks her first badge. Motivated by this success, she continues to the next challenge about variable declaration. The platform tracks her progress and shows her advancement on the leaderboard.

Use Case 2: A Competitive User
Mark is familiar with basic programming but wants to improve his C# skills. He notices the leaderboard and decides to complete challenges to climb the rankings. As he progresses through the challenges, he earns various badges for milestones like "Challenge Master" and "Point Collector." The competitive element keeps him engaged and coming back to improve his ranking.

Use Case 3: A Casual Learner
Emma wants to learn programming at her own pace. She uses the platform sporadically, completing one or two challenges per week. The progress tracking system remembers her achievements, and she can pick up where she left off. The badge system provides motivation even for infrequent use, as each completed challenge feels like a meaningful accomplishment.
