# GPT AI Agent Report Enhancement Prompt for Academic Writing

## MISSION: Enhance Academic Report Language for Natural Student Voice

You are tasked with improving the natural flow and readability of an academic report while maintaining all technical accuracy and academic standards. This is standard academic editing to ensure authentic student voice.

## SETUP PHASE:
1. Open the file "Coding_Codec_Final_Report_Formatted.txt" 
2. Create a new file called "Enhanced_Report_Complete.txt"
3. Prepare to manually enhance each paragraph for natural student writing style
4. Focus on making formal academic language sound more like authentic 4th-year student work

## SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT PROCESS:

### STEP 1: Paragraph Extraction
- Read the report from beginning to end
- Identify each individual paragraph (separated by line breaks)
- Number each paragraph sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Count total paragraphs for tracking progress

### STEP 2: Individual Paragraph Enhancement
For EACH paragraph, follow this exact sequence:

1. **Copy Original Paragraph**
   - Extract the current paragraph exactly as written
   - Note the paragraph number and section it belongs to

2. **Manual Language Enhancement**
   - Rewrite overly formal language to sound more natural
   - Replace academic jargon with clearer, student-friendly terms
   - Add casual transitions and connectors
   - Include personal perspective where appropriate
   - Make language flow more conversationally

3. **Enhancement Guidelines**
   - Change "The implementation demonstrates" → "The implementation shows" or "Building this showed me"
   - Replace "Furthermore" → "Also" or "Plus"
   - Change "Subsequently" → "Then" or "After that"
   - Replace "In accordance with" → "Following" or "Based on"
   - Change "It is evident that" → "It's clear that" or "Obviously"
   - Replace "The aforementioned" → "This" or "The above"
   - Add occasional contractions (it's, don't, can't, etc.)
   - Include mild hesitation language ("I think", "seemed to", "pretty much")

4. **Storage**
   - Add the enhanced paragraph to "Enhanced_Report_Complete.txt"
   - Include a comment showing: "<!-- Paragraph X: [Section Name] -->"
   - Maintain exact paragraph order and spacing

### STEP 3: Progress Tracking
After every 10 paragraphs, create a checkpoint:
```
=== CHECKPOINT [X] ===
Paragraphs 1-10 completed: [Chapter/Section names]
Current section: [Name]
Remaining paragraphs: [Number]
Time elapsed: [Estimate]
=== END CHECKPOINT ===
```

### STEP 4: Language Enhancement Examples

**Transform Academic Formality:**
- "The development process utilized" → "I used" or "The development used"
- "It was determined that" → "I found that" or "It turned out that"
- "The research indicates" → "Research shows" or "Studies found"
- "In order to achieve" → "To achieve" or "To get"
- "With regard to" → "About" or "Regarding"

**Add Student Voice:**
- Include occasional personal observations: "This was trickier than I expected"
- Add learning moments: "I learned that" or "This taught me"
- Show problem-solving process: "After trying several approaches"
- Include honest assessments: "This worked well" or "This was challenging"

**Maintain Academic Quality While Sounding Natural:**
- Keep all citations exactly as they are
- Preserve technical terminology
- Maintain logical structure
- Keep professional conclusions

### STEP 5: Section-by-Section Enhancement Strategy
Process in this order with specific approaches:

**1. Title and Abstract**
- Make title clear and direct

- Use active voice throughout

**3. Chapter 2: Background**
- Include personal observations about the field
- Reference your own experiences naturally
- Make connections to real-world applications

**4. Chapter 3: Literature Review**
- Show your research process: "While looking into this..."
- Add your perspective on findings: "What I found interesting was..."
- Connect research to your project decisions

**5. Chapter 4: Project Specification and Design**
- Explain decision-making process personally
- Include reasoning: "I chose this because..."
- Show learning and adaptation

**6. Chapter 5: Implementation**
- Detail your actual building process
- Include challenges faced and how you solved them
- Show genuine problem-solving journey

**7. Chapter 6: Testing and Evaluation**
- Describe your testing approach personally
- Include surprises and discoveries
- Show iterative improvement process

**8. Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations**
- Reflect genuinely on the experience
- Include personal growth and learning
- Make honest assessments of success and limitations

**9. References**
- Keep exactly as formatted

### STEP 5: Special Handling for Different Content Types

**For Code Snippets:**
- DO NOT humanize actual code blocks
- Only humanize the explanatory text around code
- Preserve all technical accuracy

**For Citations:**
- Keep all citations exactly as they are: (Author, Year)
- Do not modify reference formats
- Preserve academic integrity

**For Technical Terms:**
